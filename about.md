# What's This All About, Anyway?

Picture it: Ontario, the year 2000. I, a na√Øve 16 year old, was swept away by a handsome, older (and therefore, more experienced) man (okay, he was only 18). He convinced me to join him in his work, and away I went.

Fast forward to the present: twenty years have passed and it seems as though I've been through every kind of market there is to experience. I started as an on-the-road scrap metal buyer (becoming the biggest scrap catalytic converter buyer in Western Canada by the time I was 20), then evolved to an eBay PowerSeller, then heavy-haul truck driver, then industrial equipment salesperson, then online auctioneer (not eBay!), then wholesaler, then retailer.

I've dealt with all kinds of customers in all kinds of situations as well as employees of all kinds, and I'm here to share my story. Every day (or mostly every day), I plan on bringing you a story of some kind. Whether it's from recent or past experiences, you'll get to join me in this insane life I've lived and all the people I've dealt with.

Welcome to The Daily XP.
